# AutoML
The project automatically creates a machine learning model based on the dataset provided by the user and the target value selected from the dataset.
This project uses 
- *`streamlit` to create a basic user-interface*
- *`pandas_profiling` to automatically do exploratory data analysis and create a report which is then displayed*
- *`pycaret` to create a regression or classification model that has the best accuracy based on the dataset provided*

The `app.py` script contains the code to start the app whereas the `requirements.txt` contains the packages required to run the project.
